The UI is up and working perfectly, I divided each tab into it's own class, the main function simply intializes them and controls which one is visible. 
There are a few things need to be fixed:
  1. When deleting task right now, it deletes all the task of the same name, so we need to implement a mechanism that disallows repeating names. (I can do this)
  2. The home tabs is not visually and functionally aligend with the rest of the tabs, it's got tab buttons in the center instead of tab buttons at the top, and those buttons are not yet linked to any function,
     so no matter which button you click it is always sending you to the task tab, however, tab buttons on the task tab are working properly so you can use those. I think make the position of the buttons uniform
     across all tabs or at least functional
  3. The home page's introduction paragraph can be bigger, so basically rearrange the home page
  4. Next step for David is to write the calender class, it is the foundation for future tasks and task recording
  5. Next step for james is to make an EXP bar (numerical exp value can be seen rn from the stats tab but preferably we have one that is universally visable across all tabs).
